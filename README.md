### functions and algorithms that might be useful

 notebooks:
 
 - Step Size Distribution Analysis: functions to compute directionality using this approach <br>
 haven't been used efficiently, but has potential
 
 - Visualize Individual Trajectories: small script to visualize multiple trajectories <br>
 runs with a single input: path/to/filename (main functions are in the src folder)
 
 - photobleach-correction: automatizate photobleach correction <br> 
 approach: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28065316/
