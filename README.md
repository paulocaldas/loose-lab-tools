# Trajectory-Motion-Classification
batch of functions and algorithms to visualize and characterize different types of motion

 notebooks:
 - Trajectory_SubSegment_Classification_v2021
 (all the functions are kept here until we have a final version) 
 
 - Step Size Distribution Analysis
 (all main functions are included. Is this good enough?)
 
 - Visualize Individual Trajectories
 (runs with a single input: path/to/filename - main functions are in the src folder)
 
 
 
  ... should write some minimal documentation here at some point ...
